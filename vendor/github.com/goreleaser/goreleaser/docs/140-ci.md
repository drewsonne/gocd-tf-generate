You may want to setup your project to auto-deploy your new tags on
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org), for example:

```yaml
# .travis.yml
after_success:
  - test -n "$TRAVIS_TAG" && curl -sL https://git.io/goreleaser | bash
```

Here is how to do it with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com):

```yml
# circle.yml
deployment:
  tag:
    tag: /v[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*(-.*)*/
    owner: user
    commands:
      - curl -sL https://git.io/goreleaser | bash
```

If you test multiple versions or multiple OSes, you probably want to
make sure GoReleaser is just run once.
You could change the above example for Travis CI like this:

```yaml
# .travis.yml
after_success:
  - test "$TRAVIS_OS_NAME" = "linux" -a -n "$TRAVIS_TAG" && curl -sL https://git.io/goreleaser | bash
```
